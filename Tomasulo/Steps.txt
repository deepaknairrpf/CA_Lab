What to do each cycle:

1. Fetch instruction from memory to instruction buffer | Free slot in instruction buffer.
2. Issue one instruction (Q OR V based on Register Status) |Free RS, Free ROB.

Loop over RS:

3a. Change to Execute | In issue state, Qj Qk are 0
3b. Decrement remaining cycles | In execute state

Loop over RS:

4. Write back to ROB & All awaiting units (by looping over all RS and checking Qj and Qk) | Remaining time is zero.

Loop over ROB:

5. Commit (Write back to Register File OR Memory) OR Flush if mispredicted branch | ROB entry is ready, At head.
